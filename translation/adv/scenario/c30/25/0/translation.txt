「今ちょっといい？　もし良かったら少しだけ俺と話さない？」=Are you free right now? If it's fine with you, can we talk for a bit?
「あら、キミが噂の？　へぇ……本当に男の子なのねぇ……」=Oh, so you're the rumoured transfer student? Heh... So you really are a boy...
「あはは、そんなしみじみ言われても……俺は[P名前]って言うんだ。よろしくね」=Ahaha, even if you say it like that... They call me [P名前]. Nice to meet you.
「こちらこそよろしく。キミ、女子との会話にずいぶん慣れてるのね」=I could say the same, nice to meet you. It seems like you're already used to talking to girls.
「そんなことないって。こう見えて結構頑張ってるんだよ？　今だってドキドキしてるんだから」=It's not like that really. Doesn't it look like I'm trying my best? Even now, my heart's pounding.
「えー、そうなのかしら？　でも……ふふっ、いいわ、お姉さん信じちゃう。それで……お話ってなにかしら？」=Eh, are you sure about that? But... Fufu, that's fine, this onee-chan here will believe you. So... what should we talk about?
（大人っぽくて優しそうな娘だな。まずはどんな話をしよう……？）=(She seems like a kind and mature girl. What should we talk about first...?)
